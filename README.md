Our program will simulate a tic tac toe game. We prompt the user at each iteration for their move and have functions to print and update the board. The board gets passed to the function to update the board with the moves, which will be an input based on which row and column they desire to have for their move.

You only have to run the one tic tac toe file as it contains both the functions to simulate and implement the game and the main function to run the functions together for the game.
